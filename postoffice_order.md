# Mail pre-booking 

A system to improve/reduce time a customer spends handing over a parcel/post.
It also reduces workload of the person sitting on the other side of the counter.

## Problem/Optimization
If you have to send a parcel via public post office, you have to rely on going to a nearby post office, which is crowded in general. Some of the reasons it takes time for the person sitting in the counter to clear the queue is: 
- The person needs to enter from and to address
- Measure the weight and enter the same
- Specify the type of parcel
- Then take money in cash only and return change

All of the above steps lead to a lot of time in accepting a single parcel. If the person before you in the queue has n parcels, then this time gets compounded. 
It would be nice if this whole process of sending parcel can be opimtized.

## Idea Brief
The idea is to provide a user-interface where users can create a parcel submission/drop-off request with the parcel details before going to the post office. Following are the typical details required:
- From post office (based on user's location)
- Destination Address with PIN code
- Type of parcel (Speed/Normal)
- If possible make the payment ahead of time

Finally, the person can just go to the post-office with a uniquely generated orderID/QR Code for the order. He can show it in the post-office and drop it off. The post office can just validate the weight, verify if payment has been made and accept the parcel. 

This would simplfy the whole process for the customers as well as people working in the post office.

## Alternatives 
One alternative approach could be to simplify the entering the parcel details by the post office staff. For example from and to address can be derived by using some form of unique id for the addressses. Along with this if the post office can start accepting payments via UPI interface, then payment process also becomes faster.

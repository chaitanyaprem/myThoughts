1. An electric car that can be converted into two 2-wheelers on a need basis.
1. How IOT can be used to control and notify vehicular pollution by constant live feedback from exhaust.
1. Microscope add-on and an app to scan and fnd out chemical compositions of anything ( making it transparent) - Transparency , can be used to find out ingredients on groceries and medicines. Can be used to find out any adulteration of any product.
1. A Distributed lean operating system to reuse all old computers for processing. Only processing/RAM/network can be used.
1. Ambulance alert service to traffic police and nearby vehicles to clear/give way.
1. Directional horn for vehicles
1. U turn indicator light for vehicles.
1. Paperless ticket bus journey BMTC, use of smart card.
1. Rapid software prototyping tool just from design (using various diagrams)
1. Pods for everyone , they can accumulate and attach to a parent.Transport made easy, user can request for a pod which can come pickup. Traffic managed very well.
1. Simulator based driving training for all, driving test to include more parameters to decide. Machine based driving test monitor so that no loopholes in the system. Monitor all vehicles for driving pattern and penalize based on that to improve road sense.
1. Pay as you watch TV service.
1. Bring steel/glass back in market with attractive and light-weight storage containers etc.

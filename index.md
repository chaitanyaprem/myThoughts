These are set of pages jotting down my thoughts, ideas and possible approaches to solve some of the problems i have observed day to day.
I have tried to broadly categorize them into some buckets. 

# Categories

## Public sector related

### Post Office Mail pre-booking
- A [system](postoffice_order.md) to improve/reduce time a customer spends handing over a parcel/post.
  It also reduces workload of the person sitting on the other side of the counter.
  
### City transportation
- [Survey and feedback system](transport_system.md) for efficient utilization of buses and new routes. 
- Paperless ticket bus journey BMTC, use of smart card.
- Simulator based driving training for all, driving test to include more parameters to decide. Machine based driving test monitor so that no loopholes in the system. Monitor all vehicles for driving pattern and penalize based on that to improve road sense.

### Traffic and vehicle related improvements
- Ambulance alert service to traffic police and nearby vehicles to clear/give way.
- Directional horn for vehicles
- U turn indicator light for vehicles.
- Automatic wrong parking detection with text recognition and penalty. No need to tow vehicles.

### General
- Usage of facial recognition + biometric for important functions like voting so that fakes/duplicates are removed.

## Personal/Family use
- A [Personal Health record System](phr.md) that can keep complete patient history including reports, 
  medicines prescribed, allergies etc and integrates with all systems in the country. 
  It can also provide summaries and graphs of certain parameters over time which would be useful for doctors.
- A mobile app to scan and store medicines at home along with expiry dates. It would remind of expiry of the same .
- A mobile app that maintains complete financial data along with all required info to access the same or manage in case of untimely demise.


## Software Engineering
- Rapid software prototyping tool just from design (using various diagrams)
- A Distributed lean operating system to reuse all old computers for processing. Only processing/RAM/network can be used.

## Entertainment
- Pay as you watch TV service for all channels.

## Futuristic and abstract
- Microscope add-on and an app to scan and fnd out chemical compositions of anything ( making it transparent) - Transparency , can be used to find out ingredients on groceries and medicines. Can be used to find out any adulteration of any product.
- An electric car that can be converted into two 2-wheelers on a need basis.
- Pods for everyone , they can accumulate and attach to a parent.Transport made easy, user can request for a pod which can come pickup. Traffic managed very well.

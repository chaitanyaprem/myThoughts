### [Ideas](ideas.md)
### [Problems good to solve](problems.md)

# Topics I have thought of and detailing

## City transportation
- [Survey and feedback system](transport_system.md) for efficient utilization of buses and new routes. 

## HealthCare
- A [Personal Health record System](phr.md) that can keep complete patient history including reports, 
  medicines prescribed, allergies etc and integrates with all systems in the country. 
  It can also provide summaries and graphs of certain parameters over time which would be useful for doctors.

## Post Office
- A [system](postoffice_order.md) to improve/reduce time a customer spends handing over a parcel/post.
  It also reduces workload of the person sitting on the other side of the counter.
